<h2>We are Not Machines</h2>
<p>
    In school, we are receiving tons of information. Students are given a lecture in class, then given homework assignments, then they try to turn it in on time of they get the material, then they take a test once the unit is over. In most classes, they will not come back to that material till the final.  Then when summer hits, most students forget the information they learned during the school year. Students are memorizing information to be able to satisfy the requirements the teacher gives them. Unless the student really loves to learn, others lose the ability to critically think for themselves. One of the blessings of being human is to think for ourselves because without this ability, we are no different than machines.
</p>
<p>
    Machines do not have the ability to understand because their knowledge is based off an algorithm.  Henning Beck, <i>Phd in neuroscience</i> gave a ted talk about ideas and explained how machines do not understand at all. He gave an example of how a computer would notrecognize a yoga ball as a chair where a person would. Because we understand that a chair is simply something we can sit on, we assign the yoga ball that attribute. A computer would go through tons of images of chairs to find a match, but it would fail because it does not understand the concept.

<p>
    The <i>CTS</i> believes that we can better our education system by making kids think in a different way. The current system is helping students get ready to work in a mindless factory job. Those jobs are important, but what the world needs is more people who can change it for the better.  People who understand the world right now and can come up with their own solutions instead of being told what is right and wrong. We need more geniuses with ideas that go beyond what is known, and the <i>CTS</i>  is here to fight for that.
